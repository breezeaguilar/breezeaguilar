# About Me
## Hello! I'm Breeze (like the wind)
I'm currently a CS undergrad, Systems Engineering Intern at IPAC at Caltech and Machine Learning Lead for the College of the Canyons NASA RockSat team. Previously, I was the Software Engineering Lead for the 2025 COC NASA HASP (High Altitude Student Platform) mission. When I'm not coding, I like making art, reading and playing chess (don't ask me my ELO...).

### Professional Interests:
- Computer Vision
- Communication Systems
- Robotics
- Machine Learning
- Science Communications and Education

### At this very moment I can be found doing one of the following...
- Studying hard for my BS in Computer Science
- Training our ML models using TensorFlow for the 2026 RockSat mission
- Building a personal project on photogrammetry
- Reading *GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid* by Douglas Hofstadter
- Working towards a more comprehensive science communications approach for the COC Astronomy and Physics Club as Marketing and Media Co-Lead
- Preparing for my first chess tournament
